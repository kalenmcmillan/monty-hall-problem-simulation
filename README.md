# Monty Hall Problem Simulation
A simple Python simulation of the Monty Hall problem that runs 100,000 trials to estimate probabilities based on the gameshow. It demonstrates how switching doors increases the chance of winning from about one-third to two-thirds, confirming the counterintuitive result of the probability puzzle.

## Problem Visualized
- You are presented with three doors.
- Behind one door is a prize; behind the other two are goats.
- You pick one door.
- The host, who knows what's behind one door, opens another door to reveal a goat.
- You are then offered the chance to switch to the remaining unopened door.

## Probability Insight
- If you stay with your initial choice, you win about 1/3 of the time.
- If you switch, you win about 2/3 of the time.
- This simualtion runs many trials to confirm these probabilities.
