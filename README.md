# Monty Hall Problem Simulation
A Python script that simulates the Monty Hall problem, running 100,000 trials to calculate the probabilities of winning. It demonstrates how switching doors increases the chance of winning from about one-third to two-thirds, confirming the counterintuitive result of the probability puzzle.

## Problem Visualized
- You are presented with three doors.
- Behind one door is a prize; behind the other two are goats.
- You pick one door.
- The host, who knows what's behind one door, opens another door to reveal a goat.
- You are then offered the chance to switch to the remaining unopened door.

## Probability Insight
- If you stay with your initial choice, you win about 1/3 of the time.
- If you switch, you win about 2/3 of the time.
- This simualtion runs many trials to confirm these probabilities.
